## ⚠️ ONE MANUAL STEP REQUIRED: Add Firebase Packages

I cannot add Swift Package dependencies via command line, so you need to do this in Xcode:

**Takes 2 minutes:**

1. **Open Xcode** (if not already open)
2. **File → Add Package Dependencies**
3. **Paste this URL:**
   ```
   https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk
   ```
4. **Version:** "Up to Next Major Version" (should default to this)
5. **Click "Add Package"**
6. **Select these 4 packages:**
   - ☑️ FirebaseAuth
   - ☑️ FirebaseFirestore
   - ☑️ FirebaseAnalytics
   - ☑️ FirebaseCore
7. **Click "Add Package"** again
8. **Wait for download** (shows progress at top of Xcode)

---

## 🚀 Then Deploy to Your iPhone!

After adding Firebase packages:

1. **Select "Tin Can"** from the device menu (your iPhone 16)
2. **Press ⌘+R** or click the Play button
3. **App builds and installs!** 🎉

## 📱 On Your iPhone (First Launch)

After installation:

1. **Trust Developer**
   - Settings → General → VPN & Device Management
   - Tap your Apple ID under "Developer App"
   - Tap "Trust"

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Location "While Using App" → **Allow**
   - Sign in with Apple → **Sign In**
   - Later: Location "Always Allow" → **Change to Always**

3. **Test Your App!**
   - Complete onboarding
   - Go OUTSIDE (GPS needs open sky)
   - Tap "Start Run"
   - Walk for 2-3 minutes
   - Watch territory tiles claim! 🗺️
   - Stop run and celebrate! 🎉
